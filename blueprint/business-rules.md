# Business Rule Catalogue (Phase 17)

Eligibility/routing/validation/visibility/permission/calculation/derivation rules evidenced across BRSDs, business-rule extracts (Order Validation, Contact Validation), customer forms, and guided-journey walkthroughs. Where a source names a formal rule ID (e.g. BR-014, ORD_VALD_RULE_23), it is preserved in `source_rule_ids`. This catalogue was synthesized in chunks (raw extraction exceeded a single synthesis pass's output limit) then deduplicated by normalized name — near-duplicate rules with divergent wording may not all have been merged; treat this as thorough but not perfectly deduplicated.

**Canonical items:** 346 (deduplicated from 378 raw extracted mentions across the 83-document corpus)

**Confidence:** high 321 · medium 24 · low 1
**Classification:** Explicit 331 · Inferred 15 · Assumed 0

Every item below cites the exact source document slug(s) and evidence quote(s) it was derived from. Open the linked `.knowledge/docs/<slug>.md` for full document context per `CLAUDE.md`.
