**Documents:** 83 indexed — 77 high confidence, 6 medium confidence, 0 low confidence, 0 failed

**2026-08-21 update:** all 39 Guided Journeys documents that were originally low-confidence (screenshot-only content, text extraction recovered almost nothing) have been re-analyzed by extracting their embedded PNG screenshots directly from each `.docx` (a ZIP container) and viewing each image visually in document order — not OCR, direct multimodal reading. This recovered full field-level, screen-by-screen procedural detail for every one of them: form fields, dialog/validation text verbatim, button sequences, and final order status. 38 are now `high` confidence; 1 (`guided-journeys-prepaid-open-ui-tablet-new-prepaid-0202dd13`) is `medium` because the agent flagged an internal data discrepancy (see its Extraction notes). See each doc's "Extraction notes" section for the method and any caveats.

This corpus is the discovery/requirements record for Vodafone Qatar's ("VFQ") CRM/CVM "Stack Modernization" program — workshop transcripts, business requirement specs, business rules extracts, customer forms, and step-by-step "Guided Journey" UI walkthroughs used to design a new DXP/Open UI-based agent platform to replace the legacy Siebel/ECR/VSA stack.

## Gaps and ambiguities

- ~~Systemic extraction gap — Guided Journeys folder~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-21.** The 39 screenshot-driven Guided Journeys documents originally had almost no recoverable text via pandoc/markitdown (they only recover titles and stray image alt-text captions, not the content inside the embedded PNGs). All 39 were re-processed by extracting the embedded screenshots directly from each `.docx` and viewing them visually, in document order, recovering full field-level procedural detail. 38 are now `high` confidence; one (New Prepaid Tablet) is `medium` due to a genuine data discrepancy the recovery surfaced (see its Extraction notes). One incidental finding from this pass: `open-ui-desktop-agent-360-cti-view-8b495725`'s filename references a "CTI View" but none of its 5 screenshots actually show one — worth flagging to whoever named the source file.
- **Duplicate Form ID.** [consumer-postpaid-caf-v4-110525-editable-915fde96](docs/consumer-postpaid-caf-v4-110525-editable-915fde96.md) and [consumer-prepaid-caf-v2-110525-editable-0c369437](docs/consumer-prepaid-caf-v2-110525-editable-0c369437.md) are both stamped Form ID **PCA001** despite being distinct Postpaid vs. Prepaid forms — likely a template numbering error in the source documents, not an extraction artifact. Worth confirming with whoever owns the CAF templates before treating PCA001 as a unique identifier.
- **Damaged/incomplete source recordings.** [business-process-day11-session-2](docs/business-process-day11-session-2-20260709-155305-meeting-rec-a4630d1c.md) (cuts off at 01:09:25) and [business-workshop-day5-session-1](docs/business-workshop-day5-session-1-postpaid-service-20260701-0-a55f2808.md) (only ~29 of 186 minutes decoded) are missing content that may exist only in whatever raw recording/notes the workshop facilitators still hold.
- **Two near-duplicate CRM journey workbooks.** `CRM Journeys_Final_Updated.xlsx` and `CRM_Journeys_Final_Updated_with_Type.xlsx` appear to be the same 165-journey inventory, with the "_with_Type" version adding a taxonomy column — treat the latter as the newer/superseding version unless told otherwise.
- **Un-corroborated version marker.** `VFQ_Stack Modernization_ BR_29Jun_UpdateV1.0.pptx`'s "UpdateV1.0" filename suffix is not backed by any in-slide changelog — unclear what specifically changed from a prior version.
- **No master glossary/index found in the source data** tying journey codes (J011, J017, J023, J024, etc.) to a canonical list — they only appear scattered across the BR_25Jun/28Jun/29Jun decks. A consolidated journey-code register does not exist in this corpus if one is needed.

## Coverage exclusions

- `Consumer Postpaid CAF V4_110525 .jpg` and `Consumer Prepaid CAF V2_110525 .jpg` were **not indexed** (unsupported image extension). Both forms are already covered via their PDF/editable counterparts (`consumer-postpaid-caf-v4-110525-editable-915fde96`, `consumer-prepaid-caf-v2-110525-editable-0c369437`), which are text-extractable — the JPGs are almost certainly the same form rendered as an image and were skipped rather than guessed at.
- `.DS_Store` was skipped (system file, not a document).
