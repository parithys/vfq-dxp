// Maps the store's serialisable ToastBrand to a mark. The store holds

// like is this layer's job, which is why no ReactNode crosses into state.
//
// The Vodafone case shows the mark AND the SEGMENT (Consumer / Business),
// because for an existing customer "which operator" is not the useful half -
// the agent already knows they are at a Vodafone counter. What they need
// before they speak is which kind of customer this is.
//
// Prepaid/Postpaid used to occupy this slot and moved to the Mobile number
// row on 2026-09-25, where it reads as "(Postpaid)" directly under the
// number it describes. Keeping it here as well put the same fact on the card
// twice; and the two are different in kind anyway - a segment describes the
// customer, a relationship describes one line.
//
// The 'other' case shows the mark alone. There is no relationship to state: a
// competitor's customer has no Vodafone prepaid/postpaid standing, and
// printing one would be an invention rather than a blank.
//
// A Vodafone customer with no segment on file ALSO shows the mark alone.
// This slot briefly read "No active lines", which was wrong twice over:
//
// - It answered a question the slot does not ask. The slot is the
//   relationship type for the number Qnomy handed over; how many lines the
//   customer holds is a different fact and now has its own row.
// - It over-claimed. The two source fields count MOBILE lines only, so it
//   announced "No active lines" for a customer whose fixed-line service is
//   active - CUST-1003 holds GigaHome account ACC-5003.
//
// An empty slot is no longer ambiguous now that "Active lines" is a labelled
// row, which is what made the filler look necessary in the first place.

// STRUCTURE, for the structured variant. Header band, full-bleed rule, body:
// three stacked blocks, NOT a flex row with the rule nested inside a content
// column. The dot and the title are inside the header's own padding, so the
// rule can span the card edge to edge. Nesting it beside the dot - which is
// what this did first - insets the rule by the dot's width plus its gap, and
// no amount of padding tuning fixes that because the rule is simply in the
// wrong box.
//
// Type carries the hierarchy: the title is caption-sized, uppercase and
// tracked; labels are caption-sized and dimmed; VALUES are body-sized and
// semibold. Rendering labels and values at one size, which this also did
// first, leaves the agent no way to scan values without reading labels too.
