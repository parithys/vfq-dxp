// The app's first spinner. Every busy state before this one said so in words
// ("Loading…", "Checking the MOI registry…"), which works where there is a
// line of text to put it in and does not where the whole card is waiting -
// an agent watching a card reader needs to see that the screen is working
// before they reach for the document again.
//
// A conic-gradient ring rather than a spinning SVG arc or a row of pulsing
// dots: one element, no markup to align, and the taper reads as rotation at
// 20px where a stroked arc goes muddy. The hole is punched with an inverted
// mask, so the ring is a ring at any size without a second element sitting on
// top in the parent's background colour - which would have to know that
// colour, and would be wrong the moment this sat on a tinted surface.
//
// `--accent` for the lit end and `--border` for the track, so it reads as
// branded in both themes without a spinner-specific token.
//
// The label is announced, not drawn. role="status" (implicitly aria-live
// polite) means a screen reader hears it when the wait STARTS without the
// focus being stolen, which matters here because the agent's hands are on the
// reader. Drawing it too would duplicate whatever the caller already wrote
// beside it.
//
// Under prefers-reduced-motion the rotation stops and the ring is drawn
// complete and static - the same call tooltip-tokens.css makes, and the
// reason the status text is mandatory rather than optional: with the motion
// gone, the text is the only thing left saying "waiting".
