//
// This reverses the previous direction and returns to the evidenced rule.
// field-inventory/business-rules.json says this field "must be a local mobile

// SMS notification contact. That was overridden during the rebuild on the
// reasoning that a postpaid customer might only have a foreign number on file
// (a GCC, expat or diplomatic customer), so the validator accepted any
// 7-to-15-digit international number. Direction on 2026-09-26 is the
// documented rule after all, so the override is gone.
//
// Consequence worth knowing: a customer who genuinely has no Qatar mobile can
// no longer be given one here, and the Contact step of all four journeys that
// share this gate will hold until a +974 number is entered. That was the
// exact objection the override existed to answer, so it is recorded in
// reference/VFQ_DXP_Postpaid_Activation_Open_Questions_Reference.md rather
// than only in this comment.
//
// Separators and an optional 974/+974 prefix are tolerated on INPUT, because
