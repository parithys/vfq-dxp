          Three states:
          - non-QID: no scanner exists for these documents, so the field is

            and empty, and Fetch returns with it. Nothing announces the
            threshold - see the note above.

          The `idNumber` half of the second condition matters: a completed
          scan and an extracted number are NOT simultaneous. Reading the
          number is its own mock call, so for up to 600ms after the capture
          there is a scan but no digits - and rendering then put an EMPTY
          read-only box on screen under the hint "Read from the scanned
          document.", which is a claim about a value that had not arrived.
