// The ONE store that holds who the customer is: ID, name, segment and the rest of the summary. Two
// slices share it, with different lifetimes:
//
//   customer / recentCustomerIds   The customer the agent is looking at or serving (set from Customer
//                                  Search, Customer 360, the session reference box). Cleared from the
//                                  Dashboard and Sales workspace. Survives a browser restart.
//
//   journey                        The customer a journey is being run for, held from the moment they
//                                  are identified until the journey is explicitly ended. Nothing else may
//                                  replace it while it is held:
//                                    - Close Activity on the Activity Final page
//                                    - Save & Exit
//                                    - Abandon Order
//                                    - the session ending (sign-out; it lives in sessionStorage, so
//                                      closing the tab too)
//                                  Every record the journey writes (draft order, order, activity, lead)
//                                  takes its customer from here, so they all name the same person.
