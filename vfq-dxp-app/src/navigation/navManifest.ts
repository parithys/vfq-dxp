// THE nav manifest: one closed set of primary destinations, from which each
// role gets a filtered and reordered subset (see engines/navigationEngine.ts).
//
// This supersedes the previous "six fixed primary workspaces that can never
// grow past six" rule. That cap was a Customer-First-only assumption - a
// Hybrid role such as a Regional Manager or Supervisor legitimately spans both
// the customer and product halves of the platform, which is nine items. The
// load-bearing half of the old rule is kept and strengthened:
//
//   INV-1  The manifest is a CLOSED SET. Adding a journey or screen must never
//          add a nav item - new journeys become actions inside a workspace or
//          a Customer 360 product tab. NAV_MANIFEST_SIZE below is asserted in
//          dev, so growing the rail is a deliberate edit, not an accident.
//   INV-2  At most NAV_MAX_TOP_LEVEL top-level items per role. Extra depth is
//          expressed as `children`, never as new top-level keys.
//
// Why a TS module rather than config JSON: `icon` is SVG path geometry (code,
// not data), `to` must match a literal <Route path> in router.tsx, and
// router.tsx needs the manifest at module-eval time - before loadConfig()
// resolves, which configEngine's accessors require. Precedent for IA-as-const
// already exists here (QUICK_ACTIONS, MODULE_DESCRIPTIONS).
