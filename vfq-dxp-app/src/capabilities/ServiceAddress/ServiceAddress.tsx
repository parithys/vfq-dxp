 * address from the matching record), then the Zone / Street / Building card, then Additional Details (area, flat / unit,
 * floor, directions). A Qatari ID's registered address is looked up and offered as an editable head start. New
 * Connection, Prepaid, MNP, Fixed Line, FWA and the installation journeys.
