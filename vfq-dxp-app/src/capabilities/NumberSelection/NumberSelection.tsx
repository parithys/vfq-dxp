 * NUMBER SELECTION - the one application-wide capability for choosing a number: search, the Free and Star bands,
 * the Star price-range filter, the plan's Star entitlement note, reservation, and choosing the same number again
 * to clear it.
 *
 * Journeys mount THIS component (usually through numberSelectionStep in wizard/wizardSteps) and state what their
 * context needs; none of them wires MsisdnPicker itself.
 *
 *   variant   'journey' (default): inside a guided journey - search and sort on one row.
 *             'portal': the standalone Number Management Portal.
 *   prePaired the journey offers a Pre-Paired SIM (Mobile Prepaid BRSD MPRA_001_NUM_02): choosing it bypasses number
 *             selection, because the number is already on the SIM scanned at the SIM step.
 *   plan      the selected plan's MRC / Star entitlement, when the journey has chosen one, for the
 *             "Star Number up to QAR x is free" note. Omitted where no plan is known.
