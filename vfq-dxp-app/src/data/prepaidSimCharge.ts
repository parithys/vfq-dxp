// The BRSD: the system collects a SIM card charge when the recharge amount in the cart is below a defined limit per ID
// type, and lists "QID - 10 QAR, PASSPORT - 40 QAR". VFQ confirmed (2026-10-13) that 10 and 40 are the CHARGE amounts.
// What the BRSD does not state is the recharge limit below which the charge applies: until VFQ gives it, the limit per
// ID type is a PLACEHOLDER that carries the previous reading of those same figures (QID 10, Passport 40), so behaviour
// does not silently change. Only QID and Passport are specified; no other ID type is charged.
