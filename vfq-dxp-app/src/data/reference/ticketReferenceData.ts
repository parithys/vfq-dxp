// Shared reference data for the Trouble Ticket journey (VFQ_Trouble_Ticket_BRSD_v1.0),
// consumed by TicketCreationModal/TicketsDashboard/TicketDetail. Kept as inline
// constants rather than new mock-data JSON files - this mirrors the existing
// convention in this module (ISSUE_TYPES/TEMPLATES/QUEUES already live this
// way in TicketCreationModal.tsx) rather than introducing a new persistence
// shape for reference data the BRSD itself never gives concrete values for
// (Area/Sub-Area, Resolution Code, and Hashtag catalogues are all referenced
// by name in the requirements register but never enumerated).
//
// Documented gaps (Screens 8-13/15 gap-fix pass, 2026-09-30) - deliberately
// NOT built this round, so they stay visible rather than silently absent:
// - Screen 8: no 2MB attachment size check or file-type restriction exists
//   (attach() below only caps attachment *count*).
// - Screen 9: automatic-activity-by-category is entirely unimplemented -
//   activities are only ever added manually or as fixed one-off Auto entries.
// - Screen 10: consent-gate, role-based template editing, and an
//   "Interaction History" view are not built - only keyword search + send
//   against the real (partial) Automatic SMS template set is (see the new
//   Communication tab / TicketCommunicationTab.tsx).
// - Screen 12: "Keep-Pending for external tickets" has no code at all - no
//   status, no flag. The resolve() gate (below, resolve() call site) also
//   does not actually require Actual Issue, only Resolution Code + Hashtag -
//   left as-is since changing the gate itself wasn't in scope this round.
// - Screen 13: the Reopen reason is free text, not a controlled picklist.
// - No flag mechanism exists anywhere in this codebase - every CFL the
//   Phase 1 build plan described as "behind a flag, defaulting to X" is
//   just hard-coded to X across every screen, not only these two waves.
//
// Screen 16 (Approval Queue & Ticket Review, 2026-09-30): the Phase 1 plan's
// "AGN-001-AAV-01 to 06"/"TTJ-S16-*" citations are unattested in
// reference/.knowledge/ - same pattern as every other screen. Built against
// the real, working src/modules/order-management/OrderApprovalDetail.tsx/
// OrderApprovalQueue.tsx pattern instead (modal-state shape, submittingRef
// guard, isVisibleToAgent claim mechanic), with a ticket-appropriate
// eligibility list and reason catalogues in place of the order-specific
// approval-matrix.json/reject-reasons.json (see TICKET_APPROVAL_ELIGIBLE_
// JOB_TITLES/APPROVAL_REJECT_REASONS/APPROVAL_RETURN_REASONS above). No
// per-category approval matrix exists for tickets, unlike orders.
//
// R2 (Retention Request Capture, 2026-09-30): the Phase 1 plan's "COPS_
// TELRET1"/"TTJ-R2-*" citations and its "fully named" claim (Service Type/
// Segment/Language/Channel-source/Request-type splits, a Disconnection
// Reason LOV, multi-MSISDN-per-ticket) are unattested - none of it exists
// in reference/.knowledge/, and there is no existing ticket field, schema,
// or precedent for any of it (multi-MSISDN would be new schema work with
// zero existing extension point, not a gap-fill). R2 was also designed as
// a branch inside a Screens 1-7 ticket-creation wizard that was never built
// - this module has no wizard at all. Scoped down to only what's real:
// RETENTION_RESOLUTION_CODES above (BR-060/FLD-123's mandatory disconnection
// -closure field). Two further real rules are explicitly NOT built this
// round: BR-341 (closing a disconnection ticket should auto-create a
// disconnection order - no order-creation mechanism for this was verified
// to exist) and BR-283 (only the Retention team may cancel a disconnection
// Future-Dated-Order - an orders-module concept, not a ticket-capture one).

// MPRA-style status vocabulary correction (BRSD gap-analysis G-11): the
// BRSD's own ticket lifecycle uses these terms in the Requirements register
// (RES-01/08/09/10/11, ESC-01) - "Open"/"Reopened" appear nowhere in the
// source. Reopen returns a ticket to "Not Solved", it does not introduce a
// new state.
//
// 'Pending Approval' added (Screen 16 - Approval Queue & Ticket Review,
// 2026-09-30): unlike every other status here, this one has zero source
// evidence either way (see TICKET_APPROVAL_ELIGIBLE_JOB_TITLES below) - it
// exists purely so the screen is reachable at all, via the "Simulate -> send
// to approval" test action on TicketDetail.tsx (same convention as
// WinCashPaymentStep.tsx's "Simulate session expiry").
