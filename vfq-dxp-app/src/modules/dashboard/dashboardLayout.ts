// that could narrow to one.
//
// Removed 2026-09-27. Focus let an agent collapse a Hybrid dashboard to a
// single zone, which meant the KPI set on screen was no longer purely a
// function of the signed-in agent's configured approach - two Hybrid agents
// looking at the same role could see different things depending on a filter
// neither of their persona records mentioned. Approach alone deciding the
// view is the whole point of the requirement this satisfies.
