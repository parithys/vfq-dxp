// Role-matrix gating for the Agent 360 / Customer 360 BRSD clauses
// (APM-01/05/08, BIN-01, BIN-04, BNT-04, BR-01/02/03, BR-067, ATV-03).
//
// None of those clauses ship with a confirmed privilege matrix — OI-AGN-06/11/13
// all leave "which role" open. Until 2026-09-24 each gate was therefore a
// hand-curated Set of PERSONA-0xx ids, grounded in the 66-persona catalogue's
// own name/type text and carrying a long justification for every inclusion and
// exclusion, because inferring a role from prose was the only option available.
//
// The 26 operational roles removed that constraint: each declares its own
// `capabilities`, so these predicates are lookups rather than inferences.
// Three consequences worth recording, since they were previously documented
// caveats and are now simply resolved:
//
//   1. "Non-agent persona" is no longer a meaningful *set*. Under the 66 it
//      covered customer-side contacts, an external operator, a system account
//      and a channel partner; under the 26 only the Authorized Officer is not
//      VFQ staff. It is expressed as the positive `agent-self-service`
//      capability instead of a negative exclusion list.
//   2. canEditCustomerRecords is NO LONGER an alias of isInternalAgentPersona.
//      It was one, which would now hand customer-record write access to
//      Dispatcher, Field Engineer, System Administrator and View Only — the
//      four roles the new model explicitly separates from customer servicing.
//   3. The retail-vs-back-office manager split the old comment apologised for
//      being unevidenced is now named outright: Supervisor and Manager/Approver
//      both carry `agent-oversight`.
//
// The Qnomy/CTI reference-number gates additionally derive from `contextCard`
// — the Channel / Context-card column that previously existed only as a
// comment table in staffIdRoleMap.ts with no consumer at all.
