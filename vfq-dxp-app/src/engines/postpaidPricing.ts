 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The same arithmetic was written three times - in the Plan &
 * Add-ons summary, in the Checkout read-back, and in NewPostpaidWizard's
 * onSubmit - and the three had already drifted. Checkout omitted the discount
 * entirely, so a 15% loyalty discount on a QAR 750 plan showed the agent QAR
 * 800/mo for an order the wizard then created at 687.50: the customer was
 * quoted a price their order did not carry. One of the three also rounded and
 * the others did not, so the itemised rows failed to sum to their own total.
 *
 * Adding VAT was what made a shared module unavoidable rather than merely
 * tidy: a tax visible on one surface and absent from the other two is the same
 * bug again, with a bigger number attached.
