// is the Mobile Postpaid Activation journey named on the BRSD's J011 slide), so
// "the relevant queue" is keyed to evidenced data rather than a new field
// invented for it. Two further codes were seeded so the distinction is
// demonstrable - with a single queue, "relevant" is unfalsifiable.
//
// Role -> queues is derived from the persona's GROUP, which already exists,
// rather than a per-role table that would need editing for all 26 roles:
//
//   Sales & Acquisition            -> J011  new connections / activations
//   Customer Service & Retention   -> J020  care and complaints
//   Billing, Credit & Collections  -> J030  billing and payments
//   Management, Approval & Gov.    -> all   oversight roles cover the floor
//
// Only roles whose contextCard is 'Queue Number + Ticket Number' (plus
// oversight) ever see the control at all - see canSeeQnomyTicketNumber - so
// this is about WHICH queue, not WHETHER.
