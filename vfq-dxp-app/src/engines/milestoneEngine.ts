/**
 * Journey milestones (BRSD MPAR_001_QPC_09 "Milestone Saving"): the points at which a journey has achieved something the agent should be told
 * about, and the progress shown for them. Pure: no store, no toast - the hook that drives it (useJourneyMilestones) does those.
 *
 * A milestone is either DERIVED - `evidence(ctx)` returns a string while the journey's data shows it achieved (null when not) - or
 * EVENT-DRIVEN (no `evidence`), reached only by `reachOnEvent`, as Order Submitted is.
 *
 *   - Idempotent: a milestone already reached is never reached again, so there is no second toast.
 *   - Ordered: a milestone is reached only when every earlier one is. An out-of-order completion is reported as a warning, not reached.
 *   - Re-triggered (QPC_10): the evidence a milestone was reached on is kept. When it changes or goes (an amendment) the milestone and every
 *     later one is invalidated, and reached - and announced - again once the evidence is back.
 *   - Restored (`silent`): a draft that is resumed re-establishes what it already shows without announcing it.
