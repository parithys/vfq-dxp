# RBAC Matrix (Phase 18)

> ## ⚠ SUPERSEDED AT RUNTIME — 2026-09-24
>
> This document describes the **66-persona model**, which no longer drives the
> application. The app now runs on **26 operational roles** whose access comes
> from explicit feature grants in `public/config/personas.json`, expanded
> through `public/config/feature-catalogue.json`.
>
> | Looking for | Go to |
> |---|---|
> | Who can do what **today** | `reference/VFQ_DXP_Persona_Feature_Applicability_Matrix_Reference.xlsx` (the SSOT) |
> | Staff IDs / password / approach | that workbook → **Roles & Credentials** |
> | 66 → 26 mapping | that workbook → **Legacy Crosswalk**, or `legacyPersonaIds` on each role in `personas.json` |
> | The archived 66-persona records | `reference/blueprint/legacy/` |
>
> The 145 rows below survive verbatim as `public/config/rbac-legacy-66.json` and
> are still loaded at runtime — but **display-only**, feeding the collapsed
> "Source evidence" panel in Administration → Roles & Access. They grant
> nothing; see `configEngine.getLegacyRbacForRole()`.
>
> **The access stance inverted.** Here, absence of a row means *not evidenced*
> and is treated as hidden. Under the 26 roles, grants are exhaustive, so
> absence means *deliberately not granted*. Do not carry conclusions from this
> document into the current model without checking the workbook.
>
> Retained because it is the only place the per-row evidence quotes and source
> slugs live, and the workbook's evidence panel joins back to it.

Role → Permission → Screen Access → Action Access, derived strictly from each persona's accessible_screens/accessible_actions/restricted_features/permissions text in `personas.md` cross-referenced against `screens.md`. Personas with no RBAC entries below had no screen/action-level evidence to normalize (their general responsibilities are still documented in `personas.md`).

**Canonical items:** 145

**Confidence:** high 76 · medium 44 · low 25
**Classification:** Explicit 99 · Inferred 25 · Assumed 21

Every item cites its source document slug(s) and evidence quote(s); open `.knowledge/docs/<slug>.md` for full context per `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Coverage

61 of 66 personas have at least one normalized RBAC entry (145 entries total).

The remaining 5 are **not** a backfill gap in this matrix — they are the expected
output of the derivation rule stated above (no accessible_screens /
accessible_actions / permissions / restricted_features text to normalize). They
are recorded as open items below rather than inferred, because the alternative
is minting screen access the corpus does not support. See the next section.

---

## Open items — personas with no normalized RBAC entry (5)

Each row below was catalogued in `personas.md` from a single passing mention in
the source corpus — enough to establish that the role *exists*, not enough to
establish which screens or actions it may reach. Three of the five additionally
have **no candidate screen in `screens.md`** to point an entry at, and two are
described by the corpus as working *outside* the CRM/DXP entirely (manual
reconciliation, on-site survey). Assigning them screen access would not be a
documentation-only act: `personaEngine.ts` derives module visibility from
`rbac.json` screen IDs, so an invented row grants real navigation access in the
running application.

**Resolution owner:** VFQ Security / Business Process owners — the same open
question as OI-AGN-06/11/13 (no confirmed privilege matrix). These items should
be closed by confirmation, not inference.

| ID | Persona | Why no entry exists | What would close it |
|---|---|---|---|
| RBAC-OI-01 | PERSONA-013 EBU PM (Project Manager) | Corpus places it as a node in an approval chain ("account manager request → EBU PM → order raised → acceptance by Fulfilment, ETS, EBU and SBN"), not at a screen. No DAPN / enterprise contract-document screen exists in `screens.md`. | Confirm whether EBU PM transacts in the DXP at all, or only receives documents off-system. If in-DXP, the screen must be catalogued first. |
| RBAC-OI-02 | PERSONA-045 DSA / Store / Field Engineer (sales channel attribution) | Evidenced only as "checkboxes for DSA / Store / Field Engineer" — an **attribution field on a signed bilingual paper form**, not a logged-in actor. SCR-066/SCR-018 exist but are paper/PDF artefacts and no persona holds RBAC on either. | Confirm whether this is a system role at all, or purely a provenance field on the Acceptance Form. If the latter, reclassify in `personas.md` as an attribution value, not a persona. |
| RBAC-OI-03 | PERSONA-053 Care / Telesales & Retention / Complaints / Direct Sales / Mass Market / Mini Store / Retail & Franchise (role families) | A list of functional areas read out in one workshop; `personas.md` records "not itemized per role in this transcript". It bundles many distinct roles, so any single entry would span dozens of screens arbitrarily. | Split into discrete personas per role family, then derive per-role entries. Requires a dedicated extraction pass against the source workshop. |
| RBAC-OI-04 | PERSONA-054 Sales / Fulfilment (VFID-KID mapping team) | Corpus states the corner cases are "handled **manually** by sales plus fulfillment". No VFID/KID mapping screen exists in `screens.md`; `mock-data/vodafone-ids.json` carries the mapping fields (`mappedKidIds`, `mappingType`) but is loaded only by `mockDataEngine` with no UI consuming it. | Confirm whether manual reconciliation is expected to move into the DXP. If yes, catalogue the screen first, then derive the entry. |
| RBAC-OI-05 | PERSONA-055 Field Survey Team | Maps VFIDs to KIDs **on-site, in UIM** — outside the DXP. Same absence of a candidate screen as RBAC-OI-04. | Confirm whether any DXP surface is in scope for field survey, or whether this role stays UIM-only (in which case it needs no RBAC entry, and that should be stated). |
