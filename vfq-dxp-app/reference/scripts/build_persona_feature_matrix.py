"""Generate VFQ_DXP_Persona_Feature_Applicability_Matrix_Reference.xlsx.

Regenerate with: python3 reference/scripts/build_persona_feature_matrix.py
(run from anywhere — paths resolve relative to this script's location.)

This workbook is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the VFQ DXP operational roles:
who they are, how they sign in, what they may reach, and which action gates
they hold. It is GENERATED, never hand-edited — edit this script instead and
re-run, otherwise the next run silently discards manual changes.

Everything is read from the app's own source, so the workbook cannot drift:

  personas.json          the 26 roles: staff id, group, business unit,
                         approach, channel, context card, capabilities, grants
  feature-catalogue.json feature key -> screen ids (the shared vocabulary)
  users-agents.json      the identity each role resolves to at login
  staffIdRoleMap.ts      the demo password (parsed, not restated)
  types/config.ts        the PersonaCapability union (drift guard)
  src/modules/*/screens/index.tsx
                         which screens are actually registered, i.e. built

Two rules keep it trustworthy:

  1. ONLY implemented features appear as applicability rows. The built set is
     discovered from registerScreen() calls — the same registry the router uses
     to decide between a real screen and <ScreenNotYetBuilt>.
  2. A tick is only ever written where personas.json actually grants the
     feature. Nothing is inferred and nothing is hand-ticked.

2026-09-24: rewritten for the 26-role model. The previous version described 66
evidence-cited personas and keyed a tick to an rbac.json row; under that model
a blank cell meant "no evidence". Grants are now exhaustive, so a blank means
DELIBERATELY NOT GRANTED — the legend's central distinction is inverted. The
archived 66-persona model lives in reference/blueprint/legacy/.

# Requested 2026-09-24. Frozen panes are a viewing preference, and openpyxl
