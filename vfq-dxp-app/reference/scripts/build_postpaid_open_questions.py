"""Build VFQ_DXP_Postpaid_Activation_Open_Questions_Reference.xlsx.

Generated, never hand-edited - same rule as the persona/feature matrix.
Opening the workbook in Excel and saving will silently rewrite it.

    python3 reference/scripts/build_postpaid_open_questions.py

The MARKDOWN IS THE SOURCE. Every question, its status, body text, source
citation and priority is parsed out of

    reference/docs/VFQ_DXP_Postpaid_Activation_Open_Questions_Reference.md

and nothing is restated here, per the house rule: if a value already exists in
source, parse it rather than retype it. Edit the markdown and re-run this to
regenerate the workbook; the two cannot drift.

The parser is deliberately strict and aborts rather than emit a workbook that
silently dropped content - a question that fell on the floor because a bullet
was reformatted would be invisible in the output, and a stakeholder question
list that quietly lost three questions is worse than no list. Guards:

  - every `##` section must yield at least one parsed row
  - every item must carry a [OWED] or [GAP] tag
  - the question text must be non-empty and end up inside the bold span
  - the total row count must match the number of tagged bullets in the file
  - the priority list must reference only sections that exist
